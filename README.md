SkipLists, Hash Tables, Bloom Filters analysis made in Java

SkipLists, Hash Tables, and Bloom Filters are data structures commonly used in computer science and information technology for fast and efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.

SkipLists are a probabilistic data structure that allow for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. 
They are similar to linked lists, but with the addition of multiple levels of pointers that allow for skipping over large portions of the list during search operations, resulting in improved performance.

Hash Tables are another data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of data. 
They use a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing for constant-time access to elements based on their keys. 
In the case of collisions, multiple keys can be mapped to the same index, requiring additional processing to handle.

Bloom Filters are a probabilistic data structure used for fast and space-efficient membership testing. 
They use multiple hash functions to map elements to a bit array, which can be quickly checked to determine whether an element is likely in the set or definitely not in the set. 
However, there is a small probability of false positives due to collisions in the hash functions.

In Java, these data structures are implemented using various libraries and classes, such as the java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap and java.util.HashMap for SkipLists and Hash Tables, respectively. 
The Guava library provides an implementation of a Bloom Filter in Java as well. These structures are widely used in many applications, such as database indexing, web search engines, and network routing protocols.
